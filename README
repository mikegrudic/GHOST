GHOST: Gadget Hdf5 Output Slice and rayTrace

GHOST is a tool for creating yt-like projection and slice plots of Gadget (or Gizmo) output snapshots without all the extra overhead (no trees are built except if smoothing lengths are needed!), using the SPH kernel to produce nice smooth plots.

Installation:
Make sure to have the following python packages. All of these can be obtained with pip.
numpy
scipy
yt (just for their lovely colormap)
joblib if you want to run in parallel
hope
docopt

Then just add GHOST.py to your path for easy access:
PATH=$PATH\:/my/path/to/GHOST ; export PATH

To get a summary of the available runtime options, do:
GHOST.py --help

Basic usage example:
GHOST.py "snapshot*.hdf5" --rmax=35.0 --c=0.5,0.5,0.5

This would make all of the plots specified in PlotSettings.py for every snapshot file. The bounds of the plot window would be [-35kpc,35kpc] and it would be centered on the point [0.5,0.5,0.5].

For each particle type, you must specify the things that you want to plot in PlotSettings.py, as well as the range of your colormap.

Currently implemented data fields include:
"Density": Slice density/number density
"Temperature": Slice gas temperature
"SurfaceDensity": Projected surface density
"SigmaV": line-of-sight velocity dispersion
"KineticEnergy": KE surface density due to motion along the line of sight; equal to 0.5 * SurfaceDensity * SigmaV**2
"Q": Toomre Q parameter using line of sight velocity dispersion, and the approximation that the epicyclic frequency is approximately the orbital frequency assuming a circular orbit about the origin.
"SFDensity": Star formation surface density in solar masses/yr/pc^2


Some caveats:
- This code has only been decently tested on isolated runs with vacuum boundary conditions; use on cosmo data at your own risk!
- So far we assume the following system of units:
	Unit length: 1kpc
	Unit mass: 1e10 solar mass
	Unit speed: 1km/s
- When smoothing lengths must be calculated, we simply take the distance to the n_ngb'th nearest neighbor.
